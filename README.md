# Persistence-of-Vision-Clock
A persistence of vision clock device built for my Junior Year Project. The system is comprised of two networked Raspberry Pi's that control a motor, two custom PCBs that interface the Raspberry Pi's with peripherals, and a rotatating array of LEDs. The project was done with a partner and we used existing server code (POV_Server.py) provided by Seattle University.
