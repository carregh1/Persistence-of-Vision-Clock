# Persistence-of-Vision-Clock
A persistence of vision clock device built for my Junior Year Project. The system is comprised of two networked Raspberry Pi's that control a motor and a rotating array of LEDs, speakers, and custom PCBs that include a votlage regulator, heatsink, an H-brigdge to drive a DC motor, and an IR emitter/transceiver to calibrate the rotating arm's position. The project was done with a partner and we used existing server code (POV_Server.py) provided by Seattle University.
